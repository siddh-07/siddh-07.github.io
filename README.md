## About

This repository contains the source for my personal portfolio website. It showcases my projects, skills, and contact information in a clean, modern layout.

Short description from the repo: Portfolio

---

## Tech stack & Languages

Primary technologies used:

- TypeScript — 94.9%
- CSS — 3.1%
- HTML — 1.4%
- JavaScript — 0.6%

Other tools commonly used in the project (example): Node.js, a bundler (Vite/webpack/Parcel), and GitHub Pages for hosting.

---

## Highlights

- TypeScript-first codebase for better maintainability and type-safety.
- Responsive design using modern CSS.
- Built to be easily extended: add new projects or sections quickly.
- Ready to host on GitHub Pages (this repository follows the username.github.io pattern).

---

## Getting started (local)

These are generic steps — check `package.json` for exact scripts.

Prerequisites:
- Node.js (>= 16 recommended)
- npm or pnpm or yarn

Common commands:

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# start a local dev server (if available)
npm run dev

# build for production
npm run build

# preview production build (if available)
npm run preview
```

If the repository uses a different setup (for example no build step or a specific framework), please check `package.json` or tell me and I'll update these instructions.

---

## Build & deploy

This repository uses the GitHub Pages convention (repository name: `siddh-07.github.io`) so publishing is usually as simple as pushing the `main` branch:

- Push to the `main` branch and GitHub Pages will serve the site at:
  https://siddh-07.github.io

If your site requires a build step, make sure the build output is placed into the branch/ folder configured for Pages (commonly `gh-pages` or `main` for a username site). You can automate deployment with GitHub Actions or use a simple script such as `gh-pages` to publish the `dist` folder.

## Contributing

Thanks for your interest! If you want to suggest changes:

- Open an issue describing the change you want.
- Or fork the repo, make changes, and open a pull request.

Please keep changes small and focused. If you want me to add contribution templates, CI, or a PR workflow, I can draft those files.

## License

If you don't have a license yet, MIT is a good default. Example:

MIT License — see LICENSE file (If you'd like, I can add an MIT LICENSE file for you.)

If you'd like, I can:
- Fill the "Featured projects" section with real projects (send names + links).
- Add screenshots or a demo GIF (send images or point me to them).
- Generate an MIT license file and a basic CONTRIBUTING.md.
- Add or customize setup commands to match your project's package scripts.

```
